# Question

The endpoint `/api/data` is handled by the controller `serveData` below.

If I send a request to `/api/data?filter=frog`, how do I get the value of the query parameter `filter`?

```js
const serveData = (req, res, next) => {
  const filterValue = ???
  // use the filterValue and send back a response
}
app.get('/api/data', serveData);
```

# Answer 

```js
const serveData = (req, res, next) => { //middleware function "serveData" that brings back data. Middleware functions have access to the request (req), response (res), and next objects

  const filterValue = ??? //Here, we are trying to __store__ the Query Parameter (a portion of a URL used to filter and sort the requested data 
  //(?queryParam=value) ex. data?filter=frog !

 
}

app.get('/api/data', serveData) //app.get defines a path for any request. app.get is like a second ear that listens for requests made out to specified paths. In this case, this app.get defines a path for a request with the specific directive to retrieve data from the server.
```
We get the filter value from the request object, by accessing its keys:

```js

const filterValue = req.query.filter 

```

You forgot the response inside of the controller: `res.send(filterValue)`. It would like:
```js
const serveData = (req, res, next) => {
  const filterValue = req.query.filter;
  res.send(filterValue);
}

app.get('/api/data', serveData);
```
Solid otherwise!
