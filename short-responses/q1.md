# Question

What is the job of a server application?

# Answer
any application that runs on a server, which listens for requests and sends responses back to the client.

The responsibilities of a server application are to:
 
1. Serve static (not dynamic) files that live (or are stored in) the server (HTML, CSS, JS files)
2. Fetch and serve data from a third-party API that requires a key **(how?)** 
3. Manage and serving data from the serverâ€™s own database
